        <text class="text" x="20" y="220">
            Clean Master Privacy project was stopped for a while due to financial resources. Later, gamestime102 and gamestime102tv revived the project. There was a significant data loss after the project development was stopped, but the gamestime102 team is working to replace the lost codes with new ones.
